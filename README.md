## How to run it

Running the client:
- Download the client from Deployments -> Releases
- Read the readme.txt file
- Launch the game
- Connect to a server (by default connected to http://localhost:8080)
- Play!

Running a server:
- Download the server from Deployments -> Releases
- Read the readme.txt file
- Start the server
- Add activities via the client with a .json file of activities
  - Optional: Add images to the paths you specified when adding activities to "./server/src/main/resources/activity-bank-pictures/" starting from the root of the server
- Play!

Alternatively:
- Clone the branch
- Do ./gradlew run to launch the client
- Do ./gradlew bootRun to launch the server
- Add the activities via Postman by posting a list to "/api/activities/add"

We recommend using the activity bank for activities and images for the smoothest experience!

Note: "Connection failed" is the default error message when the server fails to provide the requested information.
This can be caused by the server not having or finding enough activities in the database.
The minimum requirement is 5 activities with distinct consumptions and 2 activities with equal activities
